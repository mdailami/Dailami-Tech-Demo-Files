# DailamiTech Project Readme.md Demo Created

## Introduction:

### This is a Readme.md statements that i m creating just demonstrating how to do it in my portfolio. Thus on Github.

### Though this is my first time of attempting such something of this king.

### Mostly readme.md is to show the documentation of or give description of your project.

### For me writing this is to give myself a fair idea as to how readme's are created inside my repository in my Githup Account.

### Thanks to Me
